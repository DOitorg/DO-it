# Description

At "DO it," we firmly believe that consistency and accountability are the cornerstones of achieving your goals, no matter how big or small. Whether you're aiming to exercise regularly, read more books, meditate daily, or develop any other positive habit, "DO it" is here to guide you every step of the way. 💪📚🧘‍♀️

## So, here's how "DO it" works:

- Step 1: Enroll in the contest and stake your money, making a promise to yourself that you will be unwaveringly consistent for the next two months. This pledge not only motivates you but also adds to the collective determination of everyone participating in the challenge.



- Step 2: You're not alone on this journey! Join a community of 200 like-minded individuals, each of whom also stakes their money to commit to their respective goals.



- Step 3: Every participant stakes $100, creating a substantial pool of $20,000. This communal investment serves as a powerful incentive for everyone to stay committed to their habits.



- Step 4: To maintain your streak and prove your consistency, you need to check-in to the gym (or complete any other habit-specific task) every single day. This daily ritual keeps you accountable and strengthens your resolve.



- Step 5: Remember, consistency is key! Should you lose a day's streak during the two months, don't worry; your money stays in the pool, contributing to the final reward.



- Step 6: The grand finale! At the end of the two months, if 20 people successfully complete their streaks, the entire $20,000 pool is evenly distributed among these incredible achievers. Each individual will receive a well-deserved reward of $1000. 🎉
